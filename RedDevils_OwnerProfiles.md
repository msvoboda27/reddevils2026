# BUBS
**Team Names:** Maize$Blue → The BG → The LGB → CRAZY → Missing in Action
**Championships:** 🏆 2019

| 2023 | 1.01 | Aaron Judge | OF |
| 2024 | 1.01 | Ronald Acuña Jr. | OF |

## Key Patterns
- **Elite OF obsession:** Takes a premium outfielder in Round 1 almost every year (6 of 7 years)
- **First SP timing:** Usually rounds 3-4 (exception: 2021 when he grabbed Cole at 1.07)
- **Closer patience:** VERY late on closers - typically Round 12-16, sometimes Round 20+
- **1B strategy:** Often waits until mid-rounds for 1B
- **Aggression level:** LOW - drafts conservatively, follows rankings

## First Closer Taken
| Year | Round | Player |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2018 | 15 | Wade Davis |
| 2019 | 11 | Craig Kimbrel |

**Average first closer: Round 14** - He will NOT start a closer run

## Exploitable Tendencies
1. Won't panic if you grab closers early - he'll wait
2. If elite OF goes early, he pivots to SP
3. Predictable Round 1 - expect Ohtani or top OF
4. Doesn't reach for guys - plays it safe

# STRATEGIC SUMMARY

## Closer Run Predictions
**Who will START a closer run?**
- Most likely: Cone (trending earlier) or Furman (Round 6 guy)
- Least likely: Bubs (waits until Round 12+)

**Who will PANIC and join a run?**
- Vic (unpredictable)
- Rich (variable timing)

**Who will IGNORE the run?**
- Bubs (almost always waits)
- TK (experienced, won't panic)

## "Their Guy" Alerts
- **TK → Kyle Schwarber** (5 times in 8 years)
- **Furman → Justin Verlander** (3 times, loves veteran aces)
- **Vic → Jose Ramirez** (back-to-back years)
- **Rich → Raisel Iglesias** (drafted twice)
- **You → Mookie Betts** (3 straight years)

## Positional Tendencies Round 1
